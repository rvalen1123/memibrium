# Memibrium — Sovereign AI Memory with Crystallization Theory

> **"It gets smarter without getting wiser."** — That's the problem this stack is built to solve.

A sovereign, self-hosted memory infrastructure implementing **Crystallization Theory** as a knowledge governance layer over tiered vector search. No cloud memory dependencies.

Adapted from [Google's Always-On Memory Agent](https://research.google/blog/) research pattern, with [RuVector](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector) (rUv) as the target hot-tier engine and [LEANN](https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN) (Berkeley SkyLab, MLSys 2026) for cold-tier compression.

**Patent POC:** CT #63/953,509 · KEOS #63/962,609 · STG (pending)

**Tiering policy = lifecycle state.** That's the paper.

| Tier | States | Engine | Latency |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hot** | observation, consideration, accepted | pgvector → [RuVector](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruvector) (Phase 2.5) | <1ms target |
| **Cold** | crystallized, shed | pgvector → [LEANN](https://github.com/yichuan-w/LEANN) compression (Phase 3) | 2-5s acceptable |

**Why RuVector for hot:** Rust-native HNSW with sub-millisecond search, built-in witness chains, SONA self-learning re-ranking, and a direct path to [Cognitum](https://cognitum.ai) hardware deployment. Created by [rUv](https://github.com/ruvnet) — the same team building the agentic chip. MIT licensed.

**Why LEANN for cold:** 97% storage compression by recomputing vectors on-the-fly instead of storing pre-built indexes. 100GB of embeddings → ~5GB on disk. Makes years of crystallized history viable on constrained hardware. From Berkeley SkyLab (MLSys 2026).

> ¹ memU stores everything then auto-organizes — no LLM gate on ingest. "Self-Evolution" is [labeled "Coming Soon"](https://memu.pro/docs) as of March 2026.
> ² memU supports `llm_profiles` for provider switching, not per-operation model routing.
> ³ memU self-hosted requires Python 3.13+, PostgreSQL + pgvector. [Import mismatch bug](https://github.com/NevaMind-AI/memU/issues/329) still open Feb 2026.
> ⁴ Roadmap. Proactive prediction = Phase 4. Hierarchical memory maps to CT crystallization layers = Phase 5.

### The CT Distinction

Every other memory system in this table stores everything and hopes retrieval sorts it out. This stack implements **principled pruning** via Crystallization Theory:

- **W(k,t) = (C × R × V) / A** — mathematical weight function drives ranking AND shedding
- **δ-decay** — recency degrades every 30 minutes. Memories must earn survival through human confirmation.
- **Human-gated crystallization** — the `confirm` endpoint is the ONLY path from `accepted` → `crystallized`. No ML confidence score can crystallize a memory. (STG Claim 1: negative limitation)
- **Witness chains** — every state transition is hash-linked, append-only, tamper-evident. Full provenance from observation to crystallization to shed. (STG Claim 6)
- **Freeze/revert** — COW snapshots let you freeze a memory (exempt from decay) and revert to any prior state. (STG Claim 7)

> *"Pruning is where most memory systems fall apart. Without decay or relevance scoring, you end up with a dense context of outdated state that can mislead the model worse than no memory at all."*

This stack doesn't just store memories. It governs knowledge.

### Lifecycle Flow

```
Content arrives
  │
  ├─ IngestAgent: score importance (LLM, informational only)
  ├─ Embed via Azure Foundry (sector-7)
  ├─ Store as OBSERVATION → gate → ACCEPTED (or stay in observation)
  ├─ Extract entities → update world-state graph
  │
  ▼ (every 30 minutes)
ConsolidateAgent:
  ├─ Apply δ-decay: R(t+1) = R(t) × (1 - δ)
  ├─ W(k,t) < 0.15 → SHED (archived, removed from hot)
  ├─ confirmation_count ≥ 3 AND validation ≥ 0.5 → CRYSTALLIZED
  └─ All transitions recorded in witness chain
  │
  ▼ (on query)
QueryAgent:
  ├─ Tier 1: Hot search (observation/consideration/accepted)
  │   Score = cosine × (1 + log(1 + W(k,t)))
  │   ≥ 2 results > 0.6? → return
  └─ Tier 2: Cold search (crystallized/shed) + topic expansion
```

## Deploy

### Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with Foundry (sector-7) access
- Terraform ≥ 1.5
- SSH key pair

### Quick Start

```bash
cd memibrium
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Edit: subscription_id, existing_cognitive_resource_group, allowed_ssh_cidrs

export TF_VAR_foundry_api_key="your-key-here"
terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
```

The VM bootstraps via cloud-init: Python, Caddy, PostgreSQL + pgvector, the CT memory server. Caddy handles TLS + Foundry auth injection.

## Files

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `server.py` | CT memory server — lifecycle engine, W(k,t), δ-decay, witness chains, 8 MCP endpoints |
| `Caddyfile` | TLS termination + local `:9999` proxy with Foundry auth injection |
| `main.tf` | Root Terraform — VM + network + cognitive modules |
| `modules/vm/cloud-init.yaml` | Full bootstrap: server, Caddy, PostgreSQL, hardening, systemd |
| `modules/cognitive/main.tf` | sector-7 data source + embedding deployment |
| `modules/network/main.tf` | VNet, subnet, NSG (443/80/22) |

## Design Decisions

1. **Crystallization Theory as governance.** The CT lifecycle engine sits ABOVE the vector store. The innovation is in the governance — W(k,t), δ-decay, human-gated crystallization — not the storage engine. Swap pgvector for RuVector, the claims still hold.

2. **Human consensus, not ML confidence.** STG Claim 1 negative limitation: `confirm` is the ONLY path to crystallization. The LLM importance score is stored for observability but does NOT drive lifecycle transitions. This is the architectural distinction from every competitor.

3. **Tiering = lifecycle state.** Observation/consideration/accepted → hot tier (fast, recent). Crystallized/shed → cold tier (deep, historical). No separate config or manual routing. The state machine IS the tiering policy.

4. **Entity graph as world state.** "I moved to Berlin" updates a Location entity, doesn't just store a new vector. The `entities` table enables contradiction detection during consolidation.

5. **Fully sovereign.** No supermemory. No cloud memory services. PostgreSQL + pgvector + Azure Foundry embeddings. Everything runs on your VM. Future: RuVector + LEANN on Cognitum hardware when available.

6. **Witness chains everywhere.** Every state transition — ingest, decay, shed, crystallize, freeze, revert — produces a hash-linked provenance entry. Tamper-evident. Append-only. This is how you prove a memory's lineage in a regulated environment (healthcare, finance).
